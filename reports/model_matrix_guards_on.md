## Reading the result

`Numeric exact match` parses every quantity out of the reference answer and requires each one to appear in the candidate as a number equal within `thresholds.numeric_epsilon`. It is the metric SPEC's numeric-exact-match acceptance criteria name, and it is deliberately *not* `strict match`: the latter compares normalized strings and scores `$1,234.50` against `1234.5` as a miss. Neither is a correctness verdict, and their biases run in opposite directions — `strict match` under-credits valid paraphrases, while numeric exact match is a presence test that cannot tell whether a figure was *used* correctly and can be satisfied by a verbose answer reciting many numbers. Read them together, and treat neither as an LLM-judge result. Rows whose reference holds no quantity, including every `unanswerable` row, are out of scope rather than scored as failures.

Every rate divides by the number of golden examples in its population, so a row that failed to produce an answer counts as a miss rather than shrinking the denominator.

Citation hit and abstention accuracy are not necessarily independent signals. On an answerable population where abstentions carry no citations and every answer that does not abstain cites an expected document, the two columns are structurally identical; inspect the row receipts before treating them as corroboration.

`Context k` is read from the manifest when recorded. For older receipts predating that field, it is recovered only when the receipt's config hash exactly matches the current config; otherwise the report shows an em dash.

`Strict match` is a deterministic lower-bound scorer: answerable rows must repeat the reference's literal amounts, dates, and identifiers; other rows require a normalized reference substring. It under-credits valid paraphrases and is not an LLM-judge verdict. Per-example reasons and complete answers live beside each manifest in its `_answers.json` receipt.

Wall latency covers the complete row, including retrieval, reranking, generation, repairs, and guardrails. Gateway latency covers completion calls only. Token counts come from provider usage when available and do not include retrieval-side embedding or keyword-extraction calls. Every displayed value is loaded from the RunManifests above, except the explicitly described config-hash recovery for historical context k; this file is generated, never hand-edited.

Unlike the rates above, median and p95 latency are computed over completed rows only: a row that failed to produce an answer is excluded from those statistics entirely rather than counted as slow. Latency denominators can therefore differ between arms in the same table, and an arm that timed out reports a tail that understates its observed worst case. Read the latency columns against each arm's coverage, and at small N treat p95 as the slowest completed row rather than a distribution.
