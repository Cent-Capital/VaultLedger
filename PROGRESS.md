# PROGRESS

Honest build log. One entry per phase: what got built, what deviated from
SPEC.md and why, and a plain-English explainer of the trickiest piece (that
paragraph is the interview prep). No backdating, no compressing — the commit
history is the receipt.

## Phase 0 — Scaffold & config  (2026-07-11)

**Built**
- Repository structure per SPEC Section 17 (package + subpackages, `app/`,
  `data/`, `reports/`, `decisions/`, `tests/`, CI).
- `vaultledger/schemas.py` — all Section 8.1 data contracts as Pydantic v2
  models (DocMeta, Chunk, Citation, RoutingDecision, GuardrailEvent, AgentStep,
  Answer, QAExample, RunManifest).
- `vaultledger/config.py` + `config.yaml` — typed loader over the Appendix B
  config (seed, budgets, loop caps, thresholds, model/tier registry).
- `app/streamlit_app.py` — the four screens (Library / Ask / Evals /
  Experiment Lab) as booting placeholders; sidebar renders live config.
- `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, README.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): ruff + schema-import check + `while True`
  lint (SPEC 15.2) + pytest.
- `tests/test_phase0.py` — Phase 0 acceptance criteria as tests.
- ADR-0001 (baseline stack).

**Acceptance criteria** — met.
- App boots: `streamlit run` serves and `/_stcore/health` returns `ok`.
- Schemas import: `import vaultledger.schemas` clean; nested `Answer` validates.
- Config loads: `load_config()` returns typed values (seed=42, budget=$40, etc.).

**Deviations from SPEC**
- Schema definition order: SPEC 8.1 lists `Answer` before the models it
  references. Defined the leaf models (RoutingDecision, GuardrailEvent,
  AgentStep) first so imports need no `model_rebuild()`. Field names and types
  are unchanged from the spec.
- Added `model_config = ConfigDict(protected_namespaces=())` on `Answer` so the
  `model_used` field doesn't trip Pydantic's protected `model_` namespace
  warning. No behavior change.

**Trickiest piece (plain English)**
`config.py` uses `pydantic-settings` with a custom source order so `config.yaml`
is the canonical source of truth, but an environment variable can still override
a single value for CI or a one-off run. The loader validates the YAML into typed
objects at startup, so a malformed config fails immediately with a clear error
instead of blowing up deep inside a retrieval loop later. That "fail loud at the
boundary" habit is why every knob in the system routes through one typed object.

**Model performance notes (fill after Ollama pull, Phase 2)**
- Dev machine RAM: _TBD_
- `qwen3:8b` tokens/sec: _TBD_
- `qwen3:4b` tokens/sec: _TBD_

**Next:** Phase 1 — synthetic data (entity-rich corpus + ground truth +
poisoned doc + wrong-total doc), regenerable byte-identical from the seed.
